LB is region specific resource. Will work on mutilpe AZs in single region

Classic Load Balancer >> Works with 2 layes: Transport and Application Layer. No advanced routing mechanism

Application Load Balancer >> Advanced compared to Classic Load Balancer. Only entertains HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Used for 
content based routing.You can just route the traffic to ports,IP addresses, containers, microservices

Network Load Balancer >> Newest, Ultra High Perfomcnae, Fast, millions of request per sec.
Should be handling millions of request, ecommerce platform.

Auto Scaling Components :1.  Auto Scaling Group 
                          It is a logical collection of identical EC2 instances.
                          Group the instances together depending upon the services/application running upon them.

For Example : ASG1 : 3 Instances > Running Wordpress Site
            : ASG2 : 4 Instances > Running Drupal Application
            
2. Launch Configuration : 
Ability to launch and terminate the instances automatically
What should be the AMI, Security Grp, EBS Volume, Instance Type, Key Pairs, Softwares/Scripts/Application ??

Auto Scaling as a service will refer to Launch Configuration to undersatnd the specification
and based upon that it will deploy the instances in auto scaling group.

3. Scaling Policies : Scale Out / Scale In
Scale Out : Increase/ Launch the num of instances within auto scaling group
Scale In  : Decrease/ Terminate(Not STOP) the num of instances within auto scaling group

4. Scaling Plan :
Fixed : Fix the num of instances up and running within ASG
Dynamic : Depending upon certain threshold, increase /decrease num of instances up and running within ASG
Dynamic Example : 
            CPU usage of entire ASG > 80, Scale Out
            CPU usage of entire ASG < 30, Scale In
Scheduled Action(Time of Day) : Depending upon Time/Date, SacleOut/ScaleIn



***********************IAM**************************************
Ex 1
User pulling image from EC2 Instance running wordpress site. Instance indirecly communicating with S3 bucket.
Instance never communicates with S3 bucket by itself.

We have to crete JSON policy and attch to IAM Role. Assign IAM role to EC2 Instance.

Ex 2
CRR 
No two regions can comm by themself

S3 Source bucket in mumbai
Another Dest S3 in NCal
Create IAM role using JSON policies and attach it to source bucket in order to copy data from source to target

Ex 3
Cross Account Access 
Steve, part of Dev root acc, wants to push the code in S3 in prod root acc.
Assign JSON policies to role and steve use that IAM role to push (using "Switch Role" command) the data to S3 bucket in aother acc. 


Policies(JSON Doc) define the permisssion for 3 entities : Users Groups and Roles
Need to Custom Policy :
50 S3 buckets, User Kunal need Read Only access to only one S3 bucket


*********************************************S3**************************
Statndard Storage Class : Default 
Features : Max amt of replication, highly available, highly durable, Real time and fast access to data, Costilist option
Use Cases : Used to store mission critical data, needs to be access frequently

Standard Infrequent Access 
Standard_IA
Same amt of replication, availability m, durability, 
But Cheaper
Downsides /Restrictions : at least 128 KB obj size, should keep for at least 30 days first as standard before converting to 
Standard_IA
Retriveal Fee : per gb back to local machine
Use Case : Any data that you access infrequently for ex Archived data 

Intelligent Tiering : Saves the data in 2 formats : Frequent access, Infrequent access
Any data that is not being accessed from last 30 days,auto transitioned to infreq category
As soon as the data is accessed again, it's moved to freq access cat

One Zone IA : Data is stored and replicated in only one AZ. Less redudant, less durable, less available and you may 
loose the data in case AZ goes down
Use Case : Less Critaical, Secondary backups

Glacier : Cheapest option in terms of storage used for archiving 
Compliance Data, Data that is not accessed frequently because there is retiival fee and retrival time is high
Optionally you can expedite the retrival but have to pay 
*********************************************VPC**********************************************************
Components you get full access upon :
1. To define the IP addresses : You can specify private IP addresses for your VPCs and Subnets
2. Sunbets > Public > Private
3. Route Tables
4. Internet Gateway
5. NACL(Network Access Contol List)
6. Virtual Private Gateway/Customer Gateway
7. NAT Device > NAT Gateway > NAT Instance
******************************************Route 53*******************************************
Routing Policiy : Simple : Just route the traffic to one of the instance in n/w
Routing Policiy : Latency Based : For user in india, Mumabi region will serve the traffic as opposed to N Cal
Routing Policiy : Weighted Routing Policy : 50% traffic to Mumbai and 50% to N Cal
Routing Policiy : GeoLocation Routing Policy : Depending upon the geo location, you will be routed to that particualr 
resource/region
                 Asia Users : Mumbai
                 North Amarica : N Cal
                 rest will not go anywhre(other than these 2 continents, will not go anywhere)
Routing Policiy : FailOver :
Mumbai : Primary/Active
N Cal : Seconday / Stand By

Route 53 will make use of cloudwatch to perform health checkup of Mumbai Region, IF Mumbai goes down, it will failover to 
the N Cal region. cloudwatch will declare mumbai as unhealthy.
We have to configure health check for this.

Routing Policiy : Multi Value Answer :
Different Instances for same domain
xyz.com >> 122.12.32.22, 132.23.32.22
