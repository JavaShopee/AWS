LB is region specific resource. Will work on mutilpe AZs in single region

Classic Load Balancer >> Works with 2 layes: Transport and Application Layer. No advanced routing mechanism

Application Load Balancer >> Advanced compared to Classic Load Balancer. Only entertains HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Used for 
content based routing.You can just route the traffic to ports,IP addresses, containers, microservices

Network Load Balancer >> Newest, Ultra High Perfomcnae, Fast, millions of request per sec.
Should be handling millions of request, ecommerce platform.

Auto Scaling Components :1.  Auto Scaling Group 
                          It is a logical collection of identical EC2 instances.
                          Group the instances together depending upon the services/application running upon them.

For Example : ASG1 : 3 Instances > Running Wordpress Site
            : ASG2 : 4 Instances > Running Drupal Application
            
2. Launch Configuration : 
Ability to launch and terminate the instances automatically
What should be the AMI, Security Grp, EBS Volume, Instance Type, Key Pairs, Softwares/Scripts/Application ??

Auto Scaling as a service will refer to Launch Configuration to undersatnd the specification
and based upon that it will deploy the instances in auto scaling group.

3. Scaling Policies : Scale Out / Scale In
Scale Out : Increase/ Launch the num of instances within auto scaling group
Scale In  : Decrease/ Terminate(Not STOP) the num of instances within auto scaling group

4. Scaling Plan :
Fixed : Fix the num of instances up and running within ASG
Dynamic : Depending upon certain threshold, increase /decrease num of instances up and running within ASG
Dynamic Example : 
            CPU usage of entire ASG > 80, Scale Out
            CPU usage of entire ASG < 30, Scale In
Scheduled Action(Time of Day) : Depending upon Time/Date, SacleOut/ScaleIn
