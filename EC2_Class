Detailed Monitoring: 1 min gap , send ping messages, check health of instance 


Dedicated Tenancy : You run ur host on dedicated host/piece of h/w

1 GiB = 1.07 GB

Delete on Terimnation : Life of EC2 instance is independent of life of EC2 instance.
Even if we delete EC2 instance, EBS volume is still secured.


Private IPs : Instance fetches private IP from range of subnet.
It's static in nature and used for internal communication.

Private IP is assocaited to public IP using the concept called NAT

As soon as you disassociate / associate elastic IP(which is same as Public IP), Instance will tend to get new public IP.
At any given point of time, you can accomadiate 5 EIPs per region.
