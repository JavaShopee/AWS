Route_53 : is a Domain Name System(DNS)

Domanin name like (facebook.com) ------hit the DNS Server---->Convert it into IPV4/IPV6 ip address ------> Hit the actual web server
DNS Server is the phonebook of the internet

Whenevr you type in website name in browser, your computer will first look into the local cache and then it hits the DNS server.

>>Example
Load Balancer running over public subnets
Private Subnet with db instacnce commuicationg with public subnet
Users typing in xyz.com, DNS Server/Route 53 will translate it Load Balancer's DNS name
Load balancer will route the traffic to instances running in public subnet

AWS they have there own DNS Service known as Route 53
other DNS Service provider in market : GoDaddy, Behost

Why Route 53? Route -->Routing, DNS uses TCP/UDP port 53

3 main functions of Route 53:
1. It's being used for domain registration, buy fresh new domain from aws
2. DNS Service : Converitng domain into IP addresses or DNS name of resources running in AWS
3. Used for Health checking, based upon that you can perform DNS failover. Route 53 works with CloudWatch to perform health check.
and to monitor the performance of your resources.

DNS Failover : If one region goes down,we have entire backup of that region.
If mumbai goes down, I can failover to N Cal

Hosted Zone : Container that contains entire routing info for your domains and sub domains


Whenver you buy domin from AWS using Route 53 as service, you get 4 NS allocated to domain.


NS  : Name Servers(actual Domain Name Servers).AWS will allocate 4 DNS that perofm the DNS resolution/DNS Servcie
      Convert Domain to IP addr of instances, end point names of instacne, IP of load balancer
SOA : Start Of Authority : Points towards primary name server(out of all 4)
     It's a master server(out of all 4)
     It will just manage majority of DNS queries 
     It will contain the entire read/ write copy of the hosted zone db
     
     
     
Create Record sets :
Type A                   : Convert domain name into IP addresses of instances IPV4
Type AAAA                : Convert domain name into IPV6 address
Type CNAME Canonical Name: use alias like facebook.com to www.facebook.com


Create 2 instances with script :
Mumbai and N Cal

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install httpd24 -y
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
echo "<html><body><h1>Hi there, this is web server</h1></body></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html

TTL(seconds) Time to live : How long the record set is cached by the web browser on the computer.
The time for which a DNS resolver caches a response is set by a value called the time to live (TTL) associated with every record.
The lower the value, faster the chnages will be propogated.

Distrubuted the traffic to different instances running in separate AZs with the help of load balancer network using 
Latency Based and Weighted Routing Policy.
For this, we need to have domain registered and go to Hosted Zone and Create Record Set
Create Record Set >> Alias Record >> Choose Mumbai / NCAL LB


Routing Policiy : Simple : Just route the traffic to one of the instance in n/w
Routing Policiy : Latency Based : For user in india, Mumabi region will serve the traffic as opposed to N Cal
Routing Policiy : Weighted Routing Policy : 50% traffic to Mumbai and 50% to N Cal
Routing Policiy : GeoLocation Routing Policy : Depending upon the geo location, you will be routed to that particualr 
resource/region
                 Asia Users : Mumbai
                 North Amarica : N Cal
                 rest will not go anywhre(other than these 2 continents, will not go anywhere)
Routing Policiy : FailOver :
Mumbai : Primary/Active
N Cal : Seconday / Stand By

Route 53 will make use of cloudwatch to perform health checkup of Mumbai Region, IF Mumbai goes down, it will failover to 
the N Cal region. cloudwatch will declare mumbai as unhealthy.
We have to configure health check for this.

Routing Policiy : Multi Value Answer :
Different Instances for same domain
xyz.com >> 122.12.32.22, 132.23.32.22
