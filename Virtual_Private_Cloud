AWS Tutorials | Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Masterclass | May 21 and 22, 2019


Is the virtual data center and you get the full control upon its resources
Flexibility and enhanced security
Isolated VPC

Components you get full access upon :
1. To define the IP addresses : You can specify private IP addresses for your VPCs and Subnets
2. Sunbets > Public > Private
3. Route Tables
4. Internet Gateway
5. NACL(Network Access Contol List)
6. Virtual Private Gateway/Customer Gateway
7. NAT Device > NAT Gateway > NAT Instance

IP addresses 
Private : Internal Communication
Can't access private IP over the Internet
Ranges (X from 0 to 255): 
10.x.x.x
172.16.X.X > 172.31.X.X
192.168.x.x

Depending upon the private IP addr range of subnet and vpc, private IP is assigend to EC2 instance 
VPC : 10.0.0.0/16
SUbnet : 10.0.2.0/24
EC2 : 10.0.2.32/24

Public IP : External Communication over the internet
Range : Except private and loop back IPs troubleshooting (127.x.x.x)
Assined by AWS/ISP
Not Static in nature : It will change as you restart the instance

XYZ.com >> DNS Service >> Public IP Addr
You have to change your DNS entries everytime the instance restarts

Elastic IP Address : Same as public but they are static in nature even you stpo and start instances multiple times
External Communication 
Account specific IPs
Maanged by customers

Downside : 5 elastic ips/region free and this is max limit for any account type
Should not be allocated to Idle/Stopped Instances otherwise AWS will start charging


Subnet : is a complete range/block of private IPs. It consists of instances and each subnet is assocaited to specific AZ.
Types of Subnet > Public Based Resources    >>  Like Web Servers
                > Private Based Resources   >>  Database resources
                
                
Internet Gateway >> Opens the access to internet for VPCs.
I IGW is enough for 1 VPC

Route Table : 
set of routes which determines how the network traffic will flow in and out of VPC
