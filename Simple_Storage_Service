Bucket : Fundamental Container
Object : Fundamental Entity

11 9's durability : 99.99...% durable
It create multiple copies of obj and stores across mutiple AZs in same region

Bucket can have unlimited amt of data /objects
Free Tier Acc : 5 GB /month S3 storage
Size of single obj should not exceed 5 tb
Any Account : 100 buckets per account

S3 Selection is global : On the same page, we can access buckets that belongs to separate regions
Anything that you will put in the bucket will be constarined and contained in that region

DNS Complaint bucket name : Unique like gmail id
Special Char : - and .
Alphanumeric Chars
lowercase
3 to 63 characters long

AES 256: Encript the data at rest, data isn't moving anywhere
Transfer Accelerations : Upto 300% faster using edge locations

User from europe can choose local edge locations to transfer data to and from mumbai.
Speed up content uploading using best optimized network path

It create multiple copies of obj and stores across mutiple AZs in same region
Storage Classes : 
Redundany
Features

Statndard Storage Class : Default 
Features : Max amt of replication, highly available, highly durable, Real time and fast access to data, Costilist option
Use Cases : Used to store mission critical data, needs to be access frequently

Standard Infrequent Access 
Standard_IA
Same amt of replication, availability m, durability, 
But Cheaper
Downsides /Restrictions : at least 128 KB obj size, should keep for at least 30 days first as standard before converting to 
Standard_IA
Retriveal Fee : per gb back to local machine
Use Case : Any data that you access infrequently for ex Archived data 

Intelligent Tiering : Saves the data in 2 formats : Frequent access, Infrequent access
Any data that is not being accessed from last 30 days,auto transitioned to infreq category
As soon as the data is accessed again, it's moved to freq access cat

One Zone IA : Data is stored and replicated in only one AZ. Less redudant, less durable, less available and you may 
loose the data in case AZ goes down
Use Case : Less Critaical, Secondary backups

Glacier : Cheapest option in terms of storage used for archiving 
Compliance Data, Data that is not accessed frequently because there is retiival fee and retrival time is high
Optionally you can expedite the retrival but have to pay 

LIfeCycle Management>Transitions 	

For current version of objects
Transition to Standard-IA after 30 days
Transition to One Zone-IA after 60 days
Expiration 	
Expire after 365 days
Permanently delete after 365 days


Replication : Cross Region Replication : Object in S3 bucket in mumbai auto replicated to S3 bucket in N Cal
We have to enable versioning on both the buckets
Apply IAM role to source bucket
Use Case : DR
