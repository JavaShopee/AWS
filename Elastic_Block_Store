EBS Vol and Instance should be in same AZ
Amazon EBS Provides ability to create snapshot(bacup) of EBS volume and write  a copy of data in volume of amazon S3,
where it is stored redundently in multiple AZ.

Snapshots are used:
Move the vols across the AZ
Create multiple new EBS vols
Expand the size of vol


When we create a volume from the snapshot, it's exactly the same copy of vol at the time snapshot was taken.
Snapshots are incremental backups, whnever you add new blocks of data to snapshots, only the data that has been changed
will be added to s3 bucket.

Elastic_Block_Store : Categories : 
Volumes   Snapshots

Volumes : Block Level Storage , You attach with EC2 and DB Instances, Virtual Hard Disks
Root Voulme : That consists of entire info to boot your instance from scratch
EBS Volumes Gurantees Durability and Security

EBS Volumes are attached and mounted with EC2 Instances

EC2 Instaces running on HP/IBM/Dell physical sever,EBS volumes running on NAS/SAN/Disk Physical Storage. Even though these
two components appears as one, behind the scene they are running on separate h/w
This increates durabbility >> Life cycle of volume is independent from Life Cycle of EC2 instance. Even in case EC2 crashes.

EBS volume is confirned in a single AZ. Same EBS can be attahced to two diff EC2 in same AZ
EBS volume is redundant in nature behind the scene. Data is replicated across servers within same AZ

EBS volume are measured in terms if GibiByte(1 GiB = 1.07 GB)
Max size of volume is 16 TibiByte

IOPS/Throughput are used to measure the perfrmance of volumes.
IOPS : Input Output Operations Per Second
Throughput : Used for Sequential IOPS operations

Volume and Instance should be in same AZ in order to allocate volume to that instance

Start menu : RUN >> diskmgmtm.msc
To be on safer side, it's recommended NOT to change the size of C drive/root volume

Whenever we encrypt the data : 
1. Data at rest will be encrypted
2. Sanpshot will be encrypted
3. I/O ops b/w EC2 instance and volume will be encrypted

To encrypt the volume, we make use of the service called KMS(Key management Service)

Key management Service wiil help you to maintain 2 types of keys >
> Default CMS(Customer Master Key)/AWS Maanged Keys : No Flexibility >> NOT FREE 
> Custom CMK (Customer managed Key) : Lot of Flexibility >> NOT FREE
We can add admin permission/usage permission to custom cmk

Volume and Key should be in same region
Volume and EC2 instance should be in same AZ


Types of voulumes : 
1. General Purpose SSD gp2
2. Provisioned IOPS SSD io1
3. Magnetic 
4. Throughput optimized HDD st1
5. Cold HDD sc1

Free Tier you will get : General Purpose SSD gp2 /Magnetic

Voulmes : SSD(Solid State Disk) 
 : Faster / Costlier /High Performace(IOPS)
 IOPS : Input Ouput Opr Per Sec : Higher the IOPS, higher the performance

/ HDD(Hard Disk Drive)
  Traditional Hard Drive/Slower(low Throughput)/Cheaper
Higher the Throughput, better the performance  


General Purpose SSD GP2 : Small to medium size envs, No consitent performance, 
On an average : Backed by Solid-State Drives (SSDs), General Purpose (SSD) volumes provide the ability to burst to 3,000 IOPS per volume
Use Case : Development Env, System Boot volumes

Provisioned IOPS SSD : Highest and consistent performance 
Max/Burst performance :100 - 64,000 IOPS
Costlient
Use Case : Casandra, Mongo DB, Dynamo DB, Ultra High Performance in terms of IOPS

IOPS to Volume Size Ratio : 50 : 1 
For each GiB of volume, you will get 50 IOPS 

Throughput optimized HDD : Long Sequentioal Operations, Big Data , ETL, Log Processing
Throughput : 500 MiB/S/GiB
  
Cold HDD : Store Cold Data /Archive Data that you don't access freq
Throughput : 250 MiB/S/GiB
Cheaper than Throughput optimized 

Magnetic : Previous generation volume 
Cheapest / Worst Performance / Experientation Lab Purpose

Snapshots : 
point-in-time backups, Incremental in nature , Disaster recovery and Data Migration
Let say snapshot for specific volume is stored in one of the S3 bucket managed by AWS
Volume is AZ specific resource wheras Snapshot is region specific
Incremental in nature : Only changed blocks will be added after first snapshot  

Volume(If Encripted) >> Snapshot (Auto Encripted) >> Duplicate Vol(Auto Encripted) >> In same or different AZ/Region

Unencrypted Sanpshot : We can make it public and share with other accounts
Anyhhing that is encrypted can't be made public
Encrypted Sanpshot : Can't be shared with other acc if encrpted using Default CMK
Encrypted Sanpshot : Can be shared with other acc if encrpted using Custom CMK + Custom CMK is already shared wiht that acc
