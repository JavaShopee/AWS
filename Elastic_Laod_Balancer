Elastic_Laod_Balancer

User sending taffic to ELB  >> Forwarding the traffic to >> 10 EC2 instances
ELB >> Security Group >> ELB-SG
10 EC2 Instances >> Security Group >> EC2-SG

Incoming Traffic to LB >> HTTP, HTTPS all traffic from externa users 0.0.0.0/0
Outgoing Traffic from LB >> HTTP, HTTPS to EC2-SG

Incoming traffic to 10 EC2 Instances >> HTTP, HTTPS from ELB-SG
Incoming traffic from 10 EC2 Instances >> HTTP, HTTPS all traffic to externa users 0.0.0.0/0

Note : Ougoing traffic should be sent from instances to the users directly(Not from LB)

SSL(Secure Socket Layer)/TLS Certificate
User -----------Transaction ------------> Banking Server
It's important that connection is closed and encrypted.
To your Banking Server, they just upload SSL/TLS Cerificate. The cerifcate is issued to ensure the channel from end user to 
Website is encrypted and kept secure.

2 Ways to upload cerificate:
1. Upload  on 10-50 instances
2. to the load balancer ?? >> SSL Termination. Load Balancer will encrpt the front end connection from users.
LB will encrpt the frond end connection and decrypt the backend traffic/connection >> called SSL termination.

AWS Certificate Manager
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) makes it easy to provision, manage, deploy, and renew SSL/TLS certificates on the AWS

If I included HTTPS/SSL Traffic in the front end, I need that certificate on my website.

LB is region specific resource. Will work on mutilpe AZs in same region
