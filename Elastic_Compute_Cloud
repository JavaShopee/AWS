Secure Resizable compute capacity in clouds
Can be scaled up or down
Can be integrated with other services(RDS, S3)
Can be integrated with VPC for providing secure network
Can be launched in one or more Regions/Availability Zones
Support for different OS


We can install OS(Windows /Linux) over EC2 instance, can run apps, install softwares, run scripts.
Compute Power: VCPU, RAM, GPU, Storage
Instance Type : Virtual representation of underlying physical resource for example t2.micro (free instance)
1 VCPU, 1 GB RAM, 8(Linux)/30 GB(Windows) storage, 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon processor

Higher Instance Type : m5.Xlarge 
3 GB Ram

Vertical Scaling : Add on the specification. Bump up the specs of exiting servers, RAM, CPU, GPU

Horizonatl Scaling : Increase/Decrease the number of instances

Amazon Machine Image: OS/Application/Software/Scrips/Services bundled/encapluslated together 
Preconfigured package / Single Template which consists of different attributes required to boot EC2 instacne from scratch

Categories : 
Public AMI : Preconfigured/default template that anyone can use.
             Disadv : less flexibility/customization
             
Customized AMI : My AMIs
> Make use of public AMIs
> Install Application/Sofware/Service/Scripts on public AMIs and then perform customization
> Capure image out of it  >> Final Product

from Customized AMI , you can launch any num of instance of any instance type with same serice / app running upon them

Example : AWS Cloud >> Launced EC2 Instance using public AMI(Amazon Linux)>> Deploy upon it Drupal Web app + MySQL DB >> 
Customization >> Capture Image >> Launced 10 EC2 instances >> same Drupal Web / MySQL db running upon them
