Secure Resizable compute capacity in clouds
Can be scaled up or down
Can be integrated with other services(RDS, S3)
Can be integrated with VPC for providing secure network
Can be launched in one or more Regions/Availability Zones
Support for different OS


We can install OS(Windows /Linux) over EC2 instance, can run apps, install softwares, run scripts.
Compute Power: VCPU, RAM, GPU, Storage
Instance Type : Virtual representation of underlying physical resource for example t2.micro (free instance)
1 VCPU, 1 GB RAM, 8(Linux)/30 GB(Windows) storage, 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon processor

Higher Instance Type : m5.Xlarge 
3 GB Ram

Vertical Scaling : Add on the specification. Bump up the specs of exiting servers, RAM, CPU, GPU

Horizonatl Scaling : Increase/Decrease the number of instances

Amazon Machine Image: OS/Application/Software/Scrips/Services bundled/encapluslated together 
Preconfigured package / Single Template which consists of different attributes required to boot EC2 instacne from scratch

Categories : 
Public AMI : Preconfigured/default template that anyone can use.
             Disadv : less flexibility/customization
             
Customized AMI : My AMIs
> Make use of public AMIs
> Install Application/Sofware/Service/Scripts on public AMIs and then perform customization
> Capure image out of it  >> Final Product

from Customized AMI , you can launch any num of instance of any instance type with same serice / app running upon them

Example : AWS Cloud >> Launced EC2 Instance using public AMI(Amazon Linux)>> Deploy upon it Drupal Web app + MySQL DB >> 
Customization >> Capture Image >> Launced 10 EC2 instances >> same Drupal Web / MySQL db running upon them



IP Address  : Com b/w servers

Private IP Addr : Internal Communcation(not supposed to be use access internet). Fre and static(stay with instance till it's life time)
Ranges of private IP addr :
10.x.x.x
172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x
192.168.x.x 
assigned by soultion architects


Public IP Addr : Public comm/Extenal/Internet comm
AWS can assign it automatically free/Client Paid/Architect Paid
If you restart the server it will change(Dynamic in nature)


Elastic IP: Relevant to AWS, same as public IPs, used for external/internet comm, they never change(static) even if you 
restart the instance

End Users >> type Domain xyz.com >> Hit the DNS server>> Translate to public IP addr of instance >> reach the website 

Range : Any except private/ Loop Back IP(for troubleshooting) 127.0.0.1
X b/w zero to 255

5 Elastic IPs /Region free

EIP when assigend to Stopped/Idle instances are paid

________________________VPC________Virtual Data Center________
Isolated DCs maintained by individual orginizations 
>> Enhanced security 
>> Transperancy
>> Flexibility
>> Isolation


Imagine VPC inside mumbai region with private IP 10.0.0.0/16 having 2 subnets(belongs to ap-south 1a and 1b AZ)

subnets : complete block of private IP adds which consists of your EC2 instances/DB instances
max 256 subnet in a VPC
Launced EC2 ins inside subnets>> 

Your instances will get the private IP from subnet range
Subet Range : 10.0.2.0/32 >> Instance IP 10.0.2.2/32
Subet Range : 10.0.3.0/24 >> Instance IP 10.0.3.3/24


Billing of Instances :
Ondemand : based on num of hours. No Partial hr billing
Reserved : 10 m5.2x large instance for 3 years>> 70% discount compared to on demand
1 yr or 3 yr contract / no 2 yr
Spot Pricing : Lab purpose/Experimatation >>90% discount compared to on demand using bidding. Instace can be terminated anytime
Dedicated hosts : Allocate a complete physical server >> Tenancy 

             Tenancy : Shared, Dedicated
             Shared : Shared among different orginizations, individuals
             Dedicated : Oracle Enterprise Edition database, software compliance and licencing
    

Per Second Billing : Num of sec consumed at least 60 sec
only support Amazon Linux/Ubuntu linux AMIs 


Cloud Watch : Default monitoring tool, gauge upon the performance of EC2 intace 
Standard Monitoring : frequency 5 min >> Free
Detailed Monitoring >> frequency 1 min >> paid


Security Group : Virtual Firewall , restrict incoming and outgoing traffic to the instance
Filters : Includes Protocal, Ports, Source/Destination IP addresses

SSH from Known IP address : port 22 for Linux bases and port 3389 for windows based EC2 instance
