Managed Policies : Managed by AWS/Customers. Can be applied to group or mutliple users or entities 

Inline Polocies : Restricted to particular user

Root Accout/Master Account : you signup using debit/credit card, Create IAM users.
Authentiation/Autherization,Manages Billing,User Activity Tracking(cloud trail)

Root account is not supposed to perform any launching, termination or deletion of resource
Permissions are given using JSON policies/documents
         Effect : Allow /Deny
         
Roles : Define permission for resources and external accounts

Roles are assigned to Serrvice for example 1, S3FullAccess Json Policy/Permission role assigned to EC2 instance in order to communicate to 
S3 Service

Ex 2
Cross region Relication : for ex S3 bucket in mumbai replicated to S3 in N Cal. AWS uses SSL/TLS to encript the data that flows
across regions.
Create IAM role and attach it to the source bucket in order to complete the replication

Ex 3 : Cross Account Access
Steve( from Developer root account) use the commnad "Switch Role" and use the IAM role to commit the code in S3 bucket (from another root 
account)

Roles are user 1. For Service to Service comm 2. Comm b/w two separate root accounts

Policies : JSON Doc, Defines permission for 3 diff entities >> User, Groups, Roles

Create a custom IAM policy and implement it

1. Create 2 S3 
2. Cretae custom IAM policy that will give read only permission to one of the bucket
3. Create Grp 
4. Attach custom IAM policy to that grp
5. Create USer and attach it to the same grp
6. Test

Object >> Fundamental entity , Any piece of data that we put in S3 bucket is called object


**************************************************************************************************
Root Acc: You signup using the pmt information using credit card or debit card
Function of root acc : Create IAM users
Function of Root Acc Owner : 
1. Authentication for users(username/pwd)
2. Autherization for users(Access type)
Root Acc Owner manages billing and can track user's activity

Root Acc owner is not supposed to perform any deletion, termination of resources >> Process Oriented approach
These activities should be performed by IAM users

JSON Policies(permissions) : What type of access each individual should have
Group : Logical collection of IAM users
Assign Policies to the group 
Permisssins are group of policies

Roles : Where you need to define the permissions for resources and external accounts 
Allows 2 services/features to communicate
Cross Account Access

Ex 1
In  normal situation, instance never communicates with S3 by itself. We have to assign a JSON policy /IAM role to EC2 Instance in order 
to initiate 2 way comm with S3 bucket


Attach the policy to the role
Attach the role to the instance

Ex2 : Cross Region Replication , no 2 regions can comm with itself
S3 bucket in Mumbai (source bucket) 
S3 bucket in NCal   (Desination bucket)

Any thing in source auto copied to dest.
Video file in S3 bucket, ability to create copy of video file and save that in dest buck : CRR
Assign policy to the role and attach role to the instance.


Ex3 : Cross Account Access

Steve having access to Dev root acc
S3 bucket in prod root Acc
Steve looking to push the code to S3 bucket 
Create IAM role assigning some JSON policies, Steve will initate the commnad "Switch Role" , he will get the temp access to S3 in other 
acc.



Policies: Defines permisssions for 3 diffeent entitie:
Users, Groups and Roles

50 S3 buckets, I m looking to give access to only one S3 bucket to Kunal  >> Custom 




Steps : 
1. Create 2 S3
2. Atach custom IAM policy to the one of the bucket for Read Only Access
3. Create gp
4. Attch Custom IAM pol to the gp
5. Create a user and attach to the same gp
