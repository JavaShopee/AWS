EC2

We never use public AMIs in production env, we use Custom/My AMIs in production env
1. Launch instance using public AMI
2. Intall upon tht app/serivces/software depending upon preference
3. Capture Sanpshot of that customized Image from that instance 

We can launch 20 Ondemand Instaces we can launch in any account ? 

IAM Role has some permisions attahced to it. For Example EC2 intance with IAM role having permission AmazonS3FullAccess
so that EC2 can push/pull images to and from S3 bucket

Cloud Watch : EC2 pust the metrics to CW. 
Metrics ; parameters you use to analyze/gauge the performce of EC2 intatnce
like CPU utilization
CW perform healthcheck every 5 mins 
It will retrive metric along with value
CPU Utilization == 70%(every 5 mins stadard monitoring)
