EC2

We never use public AMIs in production env, we use Custom/My AMIs in production env
1. Launch instance using public AMI
2. Intall upon tht app/serivces/software depending upon preference
3. Capture Sanpshot of that customized Image from that instance 

We can launch 20 Ondemand Instaces we can launch in any account ? 

IAM Role has some permisions attahced to it. For Example EC2 intance with IAM role having permission AmazonS3FullAccess
so that EC2 can push/pull images to and from S3 bucket

Cloud Watch : EC2 pust the metrics to CW. 
Metrics ; parameters you use to analyze/gauge the performce of EC2 intatnce
like CPU utilization
CW perform healthcheck every 5 mins 
It will retrive metric along with value
CPU Utilization == 70%(every 5 mins stadard monitoring)






*****************************************************************************************************************************************
EC2 : Resizeable Compute Capacity in the cloud
Compute Capacity :: vCPU, GPU, RAM , Storage

Instance Type :: It is a virtual representation of underlying physical resources
t2.micro > Instance Type
1 CPU, 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon Processor, 1 GiB RAM, 8 GiB/ 30 GiB Storage

OS > Linux / Windows + Application + Script + Software + Services  > AMI

IP Address : 
Private IPs : Internal Comm
Range  : 
10.x.x.x , 172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x , 192.168.x.x
x > 0 to 255

Public IPs :
Used for external communication
Range :  Except private IP Range
Except Loop Back IPs : 127.0.0.1 > Troubleshooting

Who assigns public IPS ? AWS Free , BYOIPs( lease public IPs from ISP) $ 
Downside of public IPs : Not Static, It changes by itself


Elastic IPs : Fixes the downside of public IPs
Same as public ips but they are static in nature, Same Range as public IPs
